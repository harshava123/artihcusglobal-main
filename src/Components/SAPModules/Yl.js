In some cases, the check-in is done by employees on-site, by security staff, or by the drivers/captains themselves. For registration by the driver, terminals are often used. Those terminals are placed outside of the yard, and the drivers enter some basic information such as transportation identification numbers and vehicle license plates. In some cases, special devices such as pagers or smartphones are distributed for communication with the drivers. This helps to send instructions and commands to the vehicles. Once all that information is verified, the execution on the yard can start.' },

For each step of the execution, commands can be sent to employees via SMS, web services, or email.' },

              SAP Yard Logistics helps you stay in control of your yard processes. SAP Yard Logistics covers various modes of transport such as trucks, rail, ships, and even aircraft. Whenever cargo is loaded from one transportation mode to another transportation mode (e.g. from a ship to trucks) or even between similar transportation modes (e.g. from a train wagon to another), the yard starts to play a key role.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mt-4">
              A yard is a restricted (company) area with restricted access. To guarantee security, each vehicle needs to be registered. After registration, the transportation unit is routed on the yard and cargo unloading or loading is performed. After all those steps, the transportation unit leaves the yard and all the actions are tracked by the system.
